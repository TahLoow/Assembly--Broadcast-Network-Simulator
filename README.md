# AssemblyProject4

This group project was completed in Microsoft Assembler (MASM). The finished product does the following:
- User chooses input network topology type. (Should node A be connected to B, and B to C the command entered is AB BC):
   - Keyboard-input topology
   - Topology read from a file
   - A default six-node network, equivalent to AB BC CD DF FE EA BF CE
- Confirms if chosen network is singular
- Program runs (Documentation to be continued)
